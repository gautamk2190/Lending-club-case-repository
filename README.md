# Project Name
You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

- The loans of term 60 months have more chances of getting defaulted.
- The states CA, DL, NY and TX have more defaulters, so the applicants of these states will default their loans more.
- Lending club should consider to check the DTI as more the DTI higher the chances that the loan will default.
- If the loan amount is high then the interest rate is also high that would make the applicants default their loans.
- The loan issued in 2011 and in the month of December are most likely to get defaulted.
